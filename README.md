# Bloc Module 1 Assessment Practice

This repo contains my practice examples for the Module 1 assessment.

## Examples
1. [Easy Mode] Build a clone of the popular developer site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (HTML and CSS).
2. [Medium Mode] Write JavaScript that will print out the popular song '99 bottles of beer' (or whatever the beverage of your choice is) to the console or the page.
3. [Extreme Mode] Copy/paste [this](http://www.recipepuppy.com/api) huge JavaScript object (JSON) data from Recipe Puppy's API and store it in a variable called  data. Use JavaScript to loop through each object in the data's array of recipes and then use JavaScript's  `document.createElement()` and `document.appendChild()` with some minimal HTML and CSS to create a recipe site.
